## Welcome to the Gene App!
In this application you will get an overview of all the sequencing data performed in your laboratory, that you can filter by several parameters to quickly find what you're looking for.
When you find the analysis you want, you can click on it and see its details. From this page you will also be able to edit the information, download it as a PDF and delete it.
To run the application locally do:
##### `npm install`
##### `npm start`

Other notes: this application was created with create-react-app with Typescript. Material-UI v5 was used as CSS library.
